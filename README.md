# eko-sim-after

A project I have been working on.

Doc with a brief explanation of what I did:\

How it works:
* You can spawn dinosaurs
* You can spawn palm trees
* You can make palm trees grow by watering them or by enabling their auto-growth
* Once a palm tree is fully grown dinosaurs will start going towards them and eating their coconuts
* Once a dinosaur has eaten 3 coconuts, it is ready to pair
* Two dinosaurs, that are ready to pair, will form a pair and go towards each other
* When they meet, they create a new fully functional dinosaur that inverits both of their features
* The cycle repeats with paired dinosaurs going to look for food again
* The dinosaurs will stand still if / while there are no available coconuts in the world to go to
